# Credit Risk Analysis & Default Prediction

## Business Problem
Financial institutions need to identify high-risk borrowers to reduce loan default losses.

## Data
This project uses publicly available Lending Club accepted loan data (2007–2018), including loan amount, interest rate, income, debt-to-income ratio, employment length, and credit score.
Due to file size constraints, a representative sample of the dataset is included in this repository.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Logistic regression modeling
- Model evaluation using AUC and ROC curve

## Results
The logistic regression model achieved an AUC of 0.71, indicating good ability to distinguish between defaulted and non-defaulted loans.

## Key Insights
- Higher interest rates, longer loan terms, and higher debt-to-income ratios increase default risk
- Higher credit scores reduce default probability

## Business Value
This analysis can support credit decision-making by improving loan approval and pricing strategies.
